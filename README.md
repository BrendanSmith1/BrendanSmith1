ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I embarked on a coding adventure at Le Wagon boot camp in October 2023, where I gained hands-on experience with a comprehensive tech stack, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku, and Ruby on Rails.

Iâ€™m currently:
* Working on a few projects to continue my understanding of Ruby and Ruby on Rails
* Learning JavaScript and React.
