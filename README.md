ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I embarked on a coding adventure at Le Wagon boot camp on July 2023, where I gained hands-on experience with a comprehensive tech stack, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku, and Ruby on Rails.

Iâ€™m currently:
  Working on a few projects
  Learning JavaScript and React
